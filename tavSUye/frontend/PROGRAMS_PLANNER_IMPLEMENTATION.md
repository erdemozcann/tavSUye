- getProgramDetails(nameEn, admissionTerm) // GET /programs/details
- getProgramCourses(programId) // GET /programs/{programId}/courses
- getPrerequisites(courseId) // GET /prerequisites/{courseId}
```

**Student Plan API** (`planApi`):
```typescript
- getPlans() // GET /student-plan/all
- deleteAllPlans() // DELETE /student-plan/delete-all
- savePlan(courseId, term) // POST /student-plan/save
```

### 5. **Routing Configuration**

**Location**: `tavSUye/frontend/src/App.tsx`

**Routes Added**:
