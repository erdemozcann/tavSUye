# Planner Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Issue: CS Prerequisites Showing for All Programs

### Problem Description
The academic planner was incorrectly showing Computer Science prerequisites for all programs (Psychology, Economics, etc.) due to hardcoded course grouping logic.

### Root Cause
The `groupCoursesByType` function in `Planner.tsx` was using hardcoded subject filters:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED)
{
  groupName: 'Core Courses',
  courses: courses.filter(c => c.subject === 'CS' || c.subject === 'MATH' || c.subject === 'PHYS'),
  requiredCredits: program?.coreCredits,
}
```

This meant:
- Psychology program would look for CS/MATH/PHYS courses (which don't exist)
- But the prerequisites system would still try to load CS prerequisites
- Users would see irrelevant CS course prerequisites in non-CS programs

### Solution Implemented

1. **Dynamic Course Grouping**: Replaced hardcoded filters with dynamic grouping based on actual courses in the program:

```typescript
// NEW DYNAMIC APPROACH
const subjects = [...new Set(courses.map(c => c.subject))].sort();

majorSubjects.forEach(subject => {
  const subjectCourses = courses.filter(c => c.subject === subject && c.faculty !== 'SL');
  if (subjectCourses.length > 0) {
    // Create groups based on actual subjects in the program
    groups.push({
      groupName: getSubjectDisplayName(subject),
      courses: subjectCourses,
    });
  }
});
```

2. **Program-Specific Grouping**: 
   - University Courses (SL faculty) - general education
   - Subject-specific groups (PSY for Psychology, ECON for Economics, etc.)
   - Elective courses from other faculties

3. **Better Subject Names**: Added friendly names for common subjects:
   - PSY → "Psychology Courses"
   - ECON → "Economics Courses" 
   - MATH → "Mathematics Courses"
   - CS → "Computer Science Courses"

4. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track:
   - Which courses are loaded for each program
   - What subjects and faculties are present
   - Which course groups are created
   - Prerequisites being loaded for each course

### Performance Improvements Also Included

1. **Aggressive Caching**:
   - Session storage cache (5-minute TTL)
   - Memory cache for course details and prerequisites
   - Request deduplication

2. **Controlled Concurrency**:
   - Limited to 8 concurrent requests instead of 797 simultaneous
   - Batched processing with delays

3. **Progress Indicators**:
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Detailed loading messages
   - Timeout warnings and recovery options

4. **Cache Management**:
   - Cache clear functionality
   - Cache statistics for debugging

### Expected Results

**Before Fix**:
- Psychology program showing CS prerequisites ❌
- Hardcoded course groups not matching program content ❌
- Confusing user experience ❌

**After Fix**:
- Psychology program shows only PSY courses and prerequisites ✅
- Dynamic grouping based on actual program content ✅
- Clear, program-specific course organization ✅
- Much better performance with caching ✅

### Testing

To test the fix:
1. Navigate to Programs page
2. Select "Psychology" program with any admission term
3. Go to planner
4. Verify only Psychology (PSY) courses appear in course groups
5. Verify no CS prerequisites are loaded
6. Check browser console for debug logs showing correct subjects

The planner should now correctly show only courses and prerequisites relevant to the selected program.
